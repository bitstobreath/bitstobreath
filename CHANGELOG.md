### Pointers

 * Tertiary monitoring tools such as recording sessions, streaming or note taking is helpful
 * Please try to order by importance under `Keep a Changelog` actions also known as change types
 * Please be consistent and avoid changes that have too many or too few
 * The phases of the project usually requires change count reduce slowly the further you are into the phases
 * For example changes into maintainance phase are minimal
 * You can also create codenames for releases
 * And maintainance phases for those releases
 * I prefer ~3 to ~17 changes for any project
 * Keep a good code base via good change quantity, frequency
 * Maintain code quality by testing and security checking

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Semantic Versioning Types of Changes

 * Major - backwards incompatible
 * Minor - functional change
 * Patch - bug fix
 * Extra - code irrelevant; optional
 * ...
 * Major version when you make incompatible API changes
 * Minor version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
 * Patch version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
 * Extra version when you make outside project work or changes
 * ...
 * Each change descriptor can have a tag after as shown (+.=.=)
 * This can suggest the modification to the Semantic Versioning
 * In accordance with the official website and to resolve disputes
 * Also if you have 7 descriptors of minor, patch or extra.. each
 * You should updates your version count like so 1.4.1.3 -> 1.11.8.10
 * Example again, 1.2.0.0 -> 1.9.7.7

### Keep A Changelog Types of Changes

 * Brief for a summary of the recent changes (similar to TL;DR)
 * ...
 * Added for new features.
 * Changed for changes in existing functionality.
 * Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features.
 * Removed for now removed features.
 * Fixed for any bug fixes. 
 * Secured in case of vulnerabilities.
