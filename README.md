# About Me 💪🏾

```paragraph
I am a '93 who enjoys working on all things tech. 👨🏾‍🔧
As I scale through the articles online discussing mental health and computational access to web or internet I found a significant correlation between unwellness and internet. 📈 on 🕸️ ~> 😷
So one of my central concerns is disseminating technology and working with data that allows families to thrive and feel good. 🤰🏾 + 👨🏾‍🍼 & 💻 keeps a 'happy family'.
As soon as I can develop the required data and code-bases (and hopefully qualifications are met), I will begin build such technologies. 🤺🛡️🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒 (protect your family)
Context is everything and many people are suffering from bad context technology or low understanding of what technology can do to one's own mind if addiction occurs.
